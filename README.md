# FunctIn

FunctIn (Functionally Incompetent) is an esoteric "functional" programming language focused on pure mathematical equations and functions (without all the complexities of other purely functional languages).

## Components

The FunctIn interpreter is written in C++, but the interpreter itself is very barebones.

FunctIn libraries, written in Ruby, can be added onto a project for more complex operations, that are used more frequently.

## Compilation

FunctIn can be compiled with the `make` command as long as Makefile and the g++ are supported.

## Run A Program

Run a program with .\FunctIn.exe <program_name> on Windows or .\FunctIn <program_name> on Unix-like platforms.
